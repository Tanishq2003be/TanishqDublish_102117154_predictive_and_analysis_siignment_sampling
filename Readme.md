** Machine Learning Model Comparison with Different Sampling Techniques **

## Overview

This repository demonstrates the application of various machine learning models on a dataset, comparing their accuracy scores. The analysis includes different sampling techniques such as Simple Random Sampling and Systematic Sampling.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- tabulate

Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn tabulate

**Steps**

Load Dataset:


**Balanced the dataset by**

Rnadomoversampling

Load the dataset (your_dataset.csv) into a Pandas DataFrame.

Apply

Simplerandom sampling
systematic sampling
stratified sampling
cluster sampling
convinience sampling

Train and evaluate the following machine learning models:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest Classifier
Neural Network (MLPClassifier)

**Results:**

Compare and display the accuracy of each model using tabulate.

**Usage**

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Tanishq2003be/TanishqDublish_102117154_predictive_and_analysis_siignment_sampling.git

python Name(Name of file)

**Notes**

Replace your_dataset.csv with the actual dataset file name.
Adjust model parameters, hyperparameters, and other configurations based on your specific dataset and task.
